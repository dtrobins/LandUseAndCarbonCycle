    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The storage and flux of terrestrial carbon is spatially heterogeneous partly due to how humans use (i.e., `land use`), manage, and change what resides on the landscape (i.e., `land cover`). To better understand the extent of land use and land cover change, extensive effort has gone into mapping historical and global land use and land cover. At least 10 different global land cover datasets have been generated. However, the spatial resolution of these global data is too coarse (30m – 1km) to accurately capture the quantity and location of land cover in highly fragmented and human dominated Settlement areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Settlement` areas are differentially defined by country, but can be generalized as all developed land not included in other `Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry` (LULUCF) sector categories reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Within the LULUCF sector, Settlements are of particular interest for carbon reporting because 1) urbanization projections estimate that 68% of the global population and greater than 87% of the North American population will reside within urban settlement areas by 2050 (UN 2018) and it is necessary to engage this population if we are to mitigate the impacts of climate change, 2) conversions from other land uses to Settlement are typically unidirectional and consist of significant manipulation of the landscape, and 3) Settlements have the potential to remove CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere or equally result in emissions, depending on the type and severity of disturbance.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there is a wealth of research linking land use and the carbon cycle (e.g., Brown et al. 2013), there remains a paucity of research, particularly the classification of land cover required for the quantification of the change in carbon on the landscape when land is converted to Settlement or to estimate carbon emissions or removals within Settlement areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "The content you will work through in this notebook builds on the following efforts to map land cover, quantify carbon stocks and change, and model urban growth based on property parcel data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Land-cover fragmentation and configuration of ownership parcels in an exurban landscape<br>\n",
    "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11252-011-0205-4\n",
    "\n",
    "* Quantifying spatial–temporal change in land-cover and carbon storage among exurban residential parcels<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To more accurately quantify carbon stocks in Settlement areas, high spatial resolution imagery (20 cm) were acquired from the Province of Ontario, Canada. The imagery were classified using object-based image analysis into one of the following `seven land cover classes: Grass, Coniferous, Deciduous, Cropland and Soil, Water, Impervious, Shadow`. Parcel data were manually interpreted using the same imagery to assign each parcel to one of the following `eleven land uses: Low Density Residential, Medium Density Residential, High Density Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Institutions, Transportation, Protected Areas, Agriculture, Water, and Under Development`. Then the land cover and land use data were intersected to derive land cover within each property parcel. The subsequent estimates of carbon are based on a combination of land use (Activity Data) and amount of area in different land covers. These estimates are then summarized by land-use type and property size within this notebook.\n",

    "An example area of the classified imagery is provided below."
